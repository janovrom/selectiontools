# Selection tools for Unity
Custom selection tools for Unity that provide some useful (and very slowly appearing in Unity) functionality that I personally miss in Unity.

Undoable actions for grouping and ungrouping:

* GameObject -> Group selected (Ctrl+Shift+G)
* GameObject -> Dissolve group (Ctrl+Delete)
